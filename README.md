##_Google's Python Class_

This is a free online class offered by Google. This class is actually used within Google to train employees in Python. The course is [here] (https://developers.google.com/edu/python/). This course is for people who already know how to code and can be thought of as an intermediate Python class that starts slow but becomes increasingly challenging as it goes. It mainly focuses on developing scripts for everyday-type automation tasks. 

I've included my code for all of the assignments, as well as the text files used in the assignments. The baby html files are used in the babynames.py script, the copy special txt and jpg files in the copyspecial.py script, and the log puzzle log files in the logpuzzle.py script. 

Each script has an explanation (docstring) of what it does. For more information on each of the assignments, reference the course page linked above.
